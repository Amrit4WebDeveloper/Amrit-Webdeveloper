            Welcome|<br>
            
            Hi, I’m Amrit — a 16-year-old web developer from India, currently studying in 1st PUC. I might still be in the early stages of my journey, but I’ve already fallen in love with coding and designing websites. What started as a small interest has quickly turned into a big part of my life — and I’m now offering my skills to real clients on platforms like Fiverr and through my personal website.
            <br><br>As a beginner, I know I have a lot to learn — and that’s exactly why I give my full attention to every project I take on. I’m not here to rush through jobs or deliver something halfway done. I care deeply about doing things the right way, even if it takes more time, because each project is an opportunity to improve, build trust, and make something I can be proud of.
            <br><br>I specialize in building simple, clean, and responsive websites — the kind that look good on any screen and are easy for your visitors to navigate. I pay attention to detail, I listen to your needs, and I’ll always communicate clearly with you throughout the process. You won’t get confusing jargon or missed messages — just honest work and a real desire to help your business grow online.
            <br><br>Joining platforms like Fiverr has helped me connect with people from different parts of the world, and every client I work with becomes part of my journey. I’m not just trying to build websites — I’m building experience, relationships, and a career I’m truly excited about.
            <br><br>If you’re looking for someone who’s enthusiastic, reliable, and genuinely eager to bring your ideas to life, I’d love the chance to work with you. Let’s create something meaningful — together.
